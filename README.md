# rwpfunctionality

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

This package offers users comprehensive documentation on surveys
conducted to assess water point functionality and management committees.
These surveys were carried out across nine countries in both sub-Saharan
Africa and South Asia.

## Installation

You can install the development version of rwpfunctionality from
[GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("openwashdata/rwpfunctionality")
```

Alternatively, you can download the individual datasets as a CSV or XLSX
file from the table below.

## Project goal

Sustained functionality of rural water systems is a global challenge.
Addressing premature failures and unreliable performance of water points
is crucial to achieve the 2030 Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 6,
which calls for universal and equitable access to safe and affordable
drinking water for all (WHO, 2017). As of 2020, 771 million people
lacked a basic water service (WHO & UNICEF, 2021). Yet even for those
with water services, unreliable water infrastructure that provides
intermittent supply, or is broken down or abandoned, contributes to
unsustainable and unsafe water access worldwide (Allaire et al., 2018;
Burt et al., 2018; Klug et al., 2018; Valcourt et al., 2020).

## Data

The data set includes observations of water point functionality and
management committee questionnaires.

The package provides access to one single data set.

``` r
library(rwpfunctionality)
```

The `rwpfunctionality` data set has 52 variables and 1793 observations.
For an overview of the variable names, see the following table.

## Examples

### Pie Chart of Water Points Functionality

What are the statuses of the water points? Are they functional?

``` r
library(dplyr)
library(ggplot2)

# Define custom colors
custom_colors <- c("lightblue", "orange", "purple")

# Create the pie chart
rwpfunctionality |>
  count(functional3) |> 
  ggplot(aes(x = "", y = n, fill = functional3)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity") +
  coord_polar("y", start = 0) +
  scale_fill_manual(values = custom_colors) +  # Set custom colors
  labs(title = "Functionality rating for water points", fill = NULL,
       x = "",  # Empty x-axis label
       y = "Count") +  # y-axis label
  scale_fill_manual(labels = c("Functional", "Partially functional", "Abandoned or not functional"),
                    values = custom_colors)  # Custom legend labels
```

Based on this pie chart, it could be interesting to redefine the
category “Partially functional” to gain insights and precision on this
aspect of the data. However, we still clearly see that only a small part
of the water points are functional.

### Water Point Types

What are the different types of water points?

``` r
# Create a horizontal bar plot of water point types
ggplot(rwpfunctionality, aes(x = wptype)) +
  geom_bar() +
  labs(title = "Distribution of Water Points Types",
       x = "Water Point Type",
       y = "Frequency") +
  coord_flip()  # Flip coordinates to make it horizontal
```
